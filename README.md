# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate images. The training process involves a generator and a discriminator competing against each other to improve image synthesis.

## Project Structure

- `data_preprocessing.py` – Prepares the dataset for training.
- `gan.py` – Defines the architecture of the GAN.
- `generator.py` – Contains the generator model.
- `discriminator.py` – Contains the discriminator model.
- `train.py` – Handles the training loop for the GAN.
- `requirements.txt` – Lists the required dependencies.
- `generated_image_epoch_0.png` – Example of an initial generated image.
- `generated_image_epoch_1000.png` – Example of a generated image after significant training.

## Setup & Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train the model:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. View generated images in the output directory.

## Results

- `generated_image_epoch_0.png`: Shows the output at the start of training.
- `generated_image_epoch_1000.png`: Demonstrates the progress after training.

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters.
- Experimenting with different architectures.
- Implementing conditional GANs.
